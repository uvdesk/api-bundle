The API bundle allows integration developers to utilize uvdesk's REST api to easily communicate with their community helpdesk system.

Installation
--------------

This bundle can be easily integrated into any symfony application (though it is recommended that you're using [Symfony 4][3] as things have changed drastically with the newer Symfony versions). Before continuing, make sure that you're using PHP 7.2 or higher and have [Composer][5] installed. 

To require the api bundle into your symfony project, simply run the following from your project root:

```bash
$ composer require uvdesk/api-bundle
```
